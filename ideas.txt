Game style:
1. Round based:
  - each round will increase in the number and speed of obstacles
  - maintain a top leaderboard of highest rounds reached
2. Survival based:
  - obstacle number and speed will increase with time
  - maintain a scoreboard of current people with their scores

Game Modes:
1. Single Player - Survival
2. Multiplayer:
 - Co-op:
  - Similar to survival, group of people work together to survive
  - will probably be based on the different ship types and utilize the unique skills to work together
 - Battle mode:
  - 1 v 1 style mode
  - items that speed up/down the obstacles (speed down can affect the other players)
  - TODO: Figure out how to support multiple sessions for this.

Ship types:
1. Speedy
 - Small in size, press space to boost and move quickly
2. Tanker
 - Big in size, press space to output a shield to make oneself invulnerable for a short period (cooldown)

Performance notes:
Atm, client drops all obstacles and creates new obstacles per obstacle every sync (15ms?)
and is probably not efficient.

What we could do is once the client receives a new obstacle, it maintains it and does not drop it at all.
- to prevent cheat, we also maintain it on the server side and check the coordinates of it with the spaceship.

Another performance impact is probably the way I clearing/drawing on the canvas. I am clearing the entire
canvas every update. I should really be just clearing the areas where drawings exist.
