Game style:
1. Round based:
  - each round will increase in the number and speed of obstacles
  - maintain a top leaderboard of highest rounds reached
2. Survival based:
  - obstacle number and speed will increase with time
  - maintain a scoreboard of current people with their scores


Ship types:
1. Speedy
 - Small in size, press space to boost and move quickly
2. Tanker
 - Big in size, press space to output a shield to make oneself invulnerable for a short period (cooldown)

Performance notes:
Atm, client drops all obstacles and creates new obstacles per obstacle every sync (15ms?)
and is probably not efficient.

What we could do is once the client receives a new obstacle, it maintains it and does not drop it at all.
- to prevent cheat, we also maintain it on the server side and check the coordinates of it with the spaceship.
